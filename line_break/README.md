# Line Break (Quebra de Linha)
[Original Challenge](http://dojopuzzles.com/problemas/exibe/quebra-de-linha/) (in portuguese).
## The Challenge
The program will receive a sentence (string) and column size (integer) and must print the sentence breaking line when it reaches the column size.

The program should never break the word in the middle.

For example, the sentence `People who live in glass houses should not throw stones` with column size `15` should be printed:

People who live

in glass houses

should not

throw stones
